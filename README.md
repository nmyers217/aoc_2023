## Advent of Code 2023
These are my advent of code 2023 answers written in typescript with Deno (EDIT: i kinda gave up on deno and switched to python in the middle because JS has really bad data structures).

This is super rushed and ugly code, and I probably won't even do every day because I'm actually super busy this month.
